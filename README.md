# GumTree
E-Commerce Website

Gumtree comes into place because we see the need for a place where the local community within a city could come together, meet, trade and help each other in many ways. Community members can come here to find an apartment to live in, sell their old car, bike,music system, laptop or furniture, promote their small business, find a tuition class or get a break as a model or actor, join a salsa class, get an audience for a local event, buy any item that they might want or have to offer and make new friends while doing all of the above.It allow you to post free ads, find what you are looking for and address your regular needs by connecting people in a faster, simpler and easier way.

Functionality:

•	Search Ads and contact sellers
•	Accessible anywhere: Online or mobile, it's quick and easy for people to search ads and post replies.
•	Price comparisons: When you visit a store, you most likely have to settle for whatever price the vendor has placed on a particular item. Not so with online ads - you have the ability to compare prices from hundreds of different replies.
•	Infinite choice: Shelf space in a brick and mortar store is limited, which means that your variety of goods is limited. Not so with an online ads.
